Data Scientist Portfolio: News Detection with Machine Learning

This dataset comprises titles, subjects, and labels designed for developing algorithms aimed at detecting fake news using machine learning. The algorithms implemented include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier.

These machine learning algorithms are intended to be valuable for predicting the authenticity of news articles, distinguishing between fake and real news.
